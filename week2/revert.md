# Git Revert Cheat Sheet
___

* **git checkout**
     is effectively used to switch branches.

* **git reset**
     basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes. It’s somewhat difficult to understand, so reading the examples in the documentation may be a bit more useful.


* **git commit --amend**
     is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit.

* **git revert**
     makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. It’s a bit like an undo command.
